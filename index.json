We prove a set of identi- fication results and numerically validate that we can simultaneously identify the frequency, variance, and persistence of income shocks. We estimate the income process on monthly panel data of 400,000 Danish males observed over 8 years.

Our analyses combine administrative data on U.S. lottery winners with an event-study design. We first examine individual and household earnings responses to these windfall gains, finding significant and sizable wealth and income effects. On average, an extra dollar of unearned income in a given period reduces household labor earnings by about 50 cents, decreases total labor taxes by 10 cents, and increases consumption by 60 cents. These effects are heterogeneous across the income distribution, with households in higher quartiles of the income distribution reducing their earnings by a larger amount. Next, we examine margins of adjustment other than earnings and, in the course of doing so, address a number of important economic questions about how additional wealth or unearned income affect retirement decisions and labor market dynamics, family formation and dissolution, entrepreneurship and self-employment, and geographic mobility and neighborhood choice. Lastly, we carefully compare our findings to those reported in existing lottery studies. This comparison reveals that existing U.S. studies substantially underestimate wealth and income effects because they use measures that understate earnings responses and overstate wealth changes associated with lottery wins.","tags":["income effects; labor supply elasticities; lottery winning; taxation; universal basic income;"],"title":"How Americans Respond to Idiosyncratic and Exogenous Changes in Household Wealth and Unearned Income","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Graber","Magne Mogstad","Gaute Torsvik","Ola Vestad"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1643673600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643673600,"objectID":"03b711cc91a2af8d2c8079b7cb2a392a","permalink":"https://michael-graber.github.io/publication/behavioral-responses-income-taxation/","publishdate":"2022-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/behavioral-responses-income-taxation/","section":"publication","summary":"In this report, we combine theory and empirical estimates for how labor earnings respond to changes in tax rates and unearned income.

Second, we introduce a separate mechanism by which house prices shocks impact consumption, differentiating between owners and renters and allowing local house price shocks to be correlated with local income shocks. Third, by exploiting differences in the location of parents and children, we allow younger families with living parents to react to shocks to parents' house prices. We show that each one of these features is crucial in accurately recovering the pass through of income and house price shocks to consumption.

The aim of the paper is to analyse the transitional dynamics of unemployment and vacancies when financial constraints are in place. We model the financial sector as a monopolistically competitive banking sector that intermediates financial capital between firms. This structure implies a per period financial resource constraint which has a closed form solution and describes the transition path of unemployment and vacancies to their steady state values. We show that the transition path crucially depends on the degree of wage flexibility. When wages do not depend on the unemployment rate the transition path is always downward sloping. This implies unemployment and vacancies adjust in opposite directions as observed in the data. When calibrating the model to the Great Recession and its aftermath we find that the lack of an improvement in the financial sector's effectiveness to intermediate resources played a crucial role in the slow recovery of the labour market.","tags":["Job search","Unemployment","Financial markets"],"title":"Unemployment and vacancy dynamics with imperfect financial markets","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

What is the relative importance of persistent shocks, transitory shocks and heterogeneous profiles? To what extent do taxes, transfers and the family attenuate these various factors in the evolution of life-cycle inequality? In this paper, we use rich Norwegian population panel data to answer these important questions. We let individuals with different education levels have a separate income process; and within each skill group, we allow for non-stationarity in age and time, heterogeneous experience profiles, and shocks of varying persistence. We find that the income processes differ systematically by age, skill level and their interaction. To accurately describe labor income dynamics over the life-cycle, it is necessary to allow for heterogeneity by education levels and account for non-stationarity in age and time. Our findings suggest that the redistributive nature of the Norwegian tax–transfer system plays a key role in attenuating the magnitude and persistence of income shocks, especially among the low skilled. By comparison, spouse's income matters less for the dynamics of inequality over the life-cycle.","tags":["Income dynamics","Insurance","Life cycle inequality"],"title":"Labor income dynamics and the insurance from taxes, transfers, and the family","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Graber","Robert Ford"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.
